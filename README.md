### Questions
- Have I properly put in the License notice per the [copyright by W3C](https://www.w3.org/copyright/software-license-2023/) for the material I used for the
toggle and dropdown menu? Under the LICENSE.txt and the Acknowledgments section of this README

Note that all other sections of this README are currently incomplete and a work in progress. I am blogging my progress on [Code Newbie](https://community.codenewbie.org/taurist) and will largely be deriving from this when filling out the README.

# Frontend Mentor - Dictionary web app solution

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for words using the input field
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
